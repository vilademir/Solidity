## Why We Chose Solidity

Our group chose to present on the programming language Solidity. Solidity is an object-oriented language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs that exist within blockchains and in this case the Ethereum blockchain. The language is compiled to bytecode and is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We chose to present on this programming language simply because some members in our group have interest or experience with cryptocurrency and blockchains.
## Why Solidity is Unique


Solidity is unique because it is a language designed to create effective smart contracts between users. This is handled by utilizing block chains to protect transactions. For example, in a simple crypto currency where two transactions that counter each other are committed at the same time, a block chain will pick one to be first and produce an error for the second attempted transaction instead of duplicating non existing values. A block chain is best imagined as a linear list of sequential transaction that are checked for validity before the next transaction occurs. Block chains are what enable user to user interaction while also maintaining security over servers.


## What are smart contracts?
Smart contracts are agreements made by a buyer and a seller, where the terms of the contract are found within the lines of code. As a result, the payment is traceable, transparent and irreversible. The idea of smart contracts first popped up in the early 1990s, but didnâ€™t appear until 2009. Benefits of smart contracts include autonomy, safety and efficiency. Users save time, money and energy using something like Solidity because it cuts out the middleman, and transactions are direct from buyer to seller and vice versa.


## Main advantage of Solidity
A main advantage of Solidity is that it is a suitable language when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Specifically, this programming language helps protect the exchange of assets, whether that be property, shares, money, etc.. When an exchange of assets occurs, the transaction actually does not go through a middleman. The transaction is protected by a smart contract, which is a computer protocol built in by Solidity to verify, advance and enforce negotiations and performance of the contract. This works by every user having their own copy of the blockchain on each device. When a transaction is sent to the blockchain it gets wrapped in a smart contract. When the transaction gets verified a copy of this smart contract gets created on the receivers end to have a completely traceable way to see that transaction in the blockchain.
