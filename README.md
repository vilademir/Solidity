## Why We Chose Solidity

Our group chose to present on the programming language Solidity. Solidity is an object-oriented language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs that exist within blockchains and in this case the Ethereum blockchain. The language is compiled to bytecode and is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We chose to present on this programming language simply because some members in our group have interest or experience with cryptocurrency and blockchains.
## Why Solidity is Unique


Solidity is unique because it is a language designed to create effective smart contracts between users. This is handled by utilizing block chains to protect transactions. For example, in a simple crypto currency where two transactions that counter each other are committed at the same time, a block chain will pick one to be first and produce an error for the second attempted transaction instead of duplicating non existing values. A block chain is best imagined as a linear list of sequential transaction that are checked for validity before the next transaction occurs. Block chains are what enable user to user interaction while also maintaining security over servers.
